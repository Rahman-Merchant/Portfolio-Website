        <h2>Hi, I'm _____ Merchant ðŸ‘‹</h2>
        <p>I'm Rahman Merchant, a student at the University of Waterloo majoring in CFM (Computer Science and Finance), currently looking for 2025 summer internships in Product Management.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m a driven innovator with a deep passion for data, software development, and creative problem-solving. My professional path has led me from working as an application developer at CIBC to steering software development and product management initiatives at Reliably Me, and now, I'm applying my skills at Questrade.</p>
          
        <p>My enthusiasm for blending technology with practical solutions has guided me to spearhead multiple innovative projects, such as the Soccer Valuation Predictor, SQL Query Generator, and a Robo-Advisor for Low-Risk Portfolios, each designed to offer strategic insights and enhanced decision-making.</p>
          
        <p>Currently, I am applying my enthusiasm for tech to build an advanced camera analytics platform for hotels. This initiative goes beyond mere operational enhancementâ€”it seeks to transform how the hospitality industry utilizes technology to advance guest experiences and security.</p>
